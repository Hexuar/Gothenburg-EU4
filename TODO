Bugs
+ Make sure event made trade cities are republics
+ Make sure danzig mission is always completeable
+ Make sure hre event works if the hre has been disbanded
+ City grows to frequent in late game
+ Great project building not working as intended, may be because alwasys = no (so they never get built even by mission), they actually do not exist anymore, they exist if you click on button som times but not built so at -1:th level and not 0:th as intended, (potential fix is having them always enabled and just not allowing upgrading before missions completed)
+ Last two missions in great project mission tree not showing up even with event firing, they are shown now but solution is not beautiful
+ Province modifiers from great project tree not showing up in province not development either (unsure if development have been fixed have not checked)
